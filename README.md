# File Management with S3 Bucket using Minio Container - SpringBoot

This Spring Boot application is designed to manage storage files using an S3 bucket with a Minio container. It provides functionality for storing, retrieving, and managing files while persisting file details in a PostgreSQL database. Below are some key points about this project:

## Docker Compose Configuration

The application utilizes Docker Compose to set up the required containers. The `docker-compose.yml` file is used to define and run the following containers:

- **Minio Container**: This container hosts the Minio object storage server, which is used as an S3-compatible storage system.

- **PostgreSQL Container**: This container hosts the PostgreSQL database where file details are stored.

## FileAttachment Entity

The application includes a `FileAttachment` entity to store details about the uploaded files in the database. This entity contains the following attributes:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each file attachment.
- `bucketName`: The name of the S3 bucket where the file is stored.
- `fileName`: The name of the uploaded file.
- `fileSize`: The size of the file in bytes.
- `contentType`: The MIME type of the file.
- `objectName`: The name of the file object within the S3 bucket.

You can customize the entity based on your specific requirements.

## AmazonS3 Integration

The application utilizes the Amazon S3 API to manage buckets and interact with files in the Minio container. The Amazon S3 API is compatible with Minio, making it easy to work with S3-like storage systems.

You can use libraries like the AWS SDK for Java to perform operations such as creating buckets, uploading files, and retrieving files from the Minio container.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Spring Boot task for file management:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

3. Modify the `application.properties` file or `application.yml` to configure your database connection and any other application-specific settings.

4. Run `docker-compose up` to start the Minio and PostgreSQL containers.

5. Build and run the Spring Boot application.

6. Use the application to upload, retrieve, and manage files in the Minio S3 bucket.

Feel free to customize and extend the application to meet your specific file management needs. You can add additional features such as user authentication, access control, and more based on your requirements.
